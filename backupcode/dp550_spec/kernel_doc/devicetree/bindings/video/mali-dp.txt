* ARM Mali-DP Display devices

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "arm,mali-dpxxx" where "xxx" is the product number
- reg: Physical base address and length of the registers in the system
- interrupts: the interrupt line numbers of the device in the system
- interrupt-names: contains the names of the IRQs in the order they were
provided in the "interrupts" property. Must contain: "SE", "DE".
- clocks: should contain a phandle + clock-specifier pair for each clock
entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain:
      * "mclk": main clock
      * "pclk": APB interface clock
      * "aclk": AXI interface clock
      * "pxclk": pixel clock

Optional properties:
- de-axi-burst-length: this is the burst length in bytes that the DE will use
for reading data from the AXI interface.
  Allowed parameters are: <1>, <2>, <4>, <8>, <16>, <32>, <64>, <128>, <256>
- de-axi-poutstdcab: this is AXI outstanding transcations capability during
  prefetch region. Valid value range 1 - 32. This property is only available
  in DP550.
- de-axi-outstanding-transactions: this is the number of outstanding
transactions which can be generated by the DE. Valid values range 1-32.
- de-axi-arqos-threshold-low: the DE input FIFO level low threshold. Valid value
range 1 - (FIFO size - 1).
- de-axi-arqos-threshold-high: the DE input FIFO level high threshold. Valid
value range 1 - (FIFO size - 1) and should not be less than value indicated by
de-axi-arqos-threshold-low.
- de-axi-arqos-red: Close to underflow ARQOS value. Valid value range 0 - 15.
- de-axi-arqos-green: Normal conditions ARQOS value. Valid value range 0 - 15.
- se-axi-burst-length: this is the burst length in bytes  the SE will use for
writing data to the AXI interface.
  Allowed parameters are: <1>, <2>, <4>, <8>, <16>, <32>, <64>, <128>, <256>
- se-axi-outstanding-transactions: this is the number of outstanding
transactions which can be generated by the SE. Valid values range 1-32.
- se-axi-awqos: identifier used by the AXI4 interface to establish a QoS mechanism.
  Values must be in the range [0-15].
- se-axi-awcache: memory type as defined by the AXI4 specification.
  Values must be in the range [0-15].
- rotmem: the size (in KB) of the available rotation memory

The device node should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
node, according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt. The endpoint has the following required
properties:
- remote-endpoint: The phandle of the 'input' endpoint of the attached video
transmitter device.

Note: Each Mali-DP node should have an alias "malidpX" where X is a correct
number in the "aliases" node.

Example:

aliases {
	malidp0 = &dp0;
};

dp0: display {
	compatible = "arm,mali-dp500";
	reg = <0xf0040000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 39 4>, <0 40 4>;
	interrupt-names = "SE", "DE";
	clocks = <&db2oscclk2>, <&db2oscclk2>, <&db2oscclk0>, <&db2oscclk0>;
	clock-names = "pxclk", "mclk", "aclk", "pclk";
	de-axi-burst-length = <32>;
	de-axi-outstanding-transactions = <15>;
	de-axi-arqos-threshold-low = <112>;
	de-axi-arqos-threshold-high = <128>;
	de-axi-arqos-red = <1>;
	de-axi-arqos-green = <0>;
	se-axi-burst-length = <32>;
	se-axi-outstanding-transactions = <15>;
	se-axi-awqos = <15>;
	se-axi-awcache = <0>;
	rotmem = <64>;
	port {
		dp0_out: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&tx0_in>;
		};
	};
};

tx0: video-transmitter {
	compatible = "foo,bar-tx";
	port {
		tx0_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&dp0_out>;
		};
	};
};
