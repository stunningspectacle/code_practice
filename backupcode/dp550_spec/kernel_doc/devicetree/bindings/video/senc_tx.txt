* DRM slave encoder video-tx wrapper

This node is for a virtual device which provides a shim to interface a DRM
slave encoder with the video-tx framework.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "generic,slave_enc_video_tx"
- i2c-slave: The phandle of the slave encoder's node

Optional properties:
- type: The connector type the transmitter uses
  Allowed values: "HDMI", "DVI"
- type-idx: The number of the connector of the given type, for instance
  HDMI-0 and HDMI-1 would have type-idx = <0> and <1> respectively.

The device node should contain one 'port' child node with one child 'endpoint'
node according to the bindings defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/
media/video-interfaces.txt. The endpoint has the following required
properties:
- remote-endpoint: The phandle of the 'output' endpoint of the attached video
source device.

Example:

tx0: video_tx@0 {
	compatible = "generic,slave_enc_video_tx";
	reg = <0>;
	i2c-slave = <&dvi2>;
	type = "HDMI";
	type-idx = <0>;
	port {
		tx0_in: endpoint {
			remote-endpoint = <&dp0_out>;
		};
	};
};
