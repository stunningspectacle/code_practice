The goal of this chapter is to write a complete char device driver. We develop a char-
acter driver because this class is suitable for most simple hardware devices. Char
drivers are also easier to understand than block drivers or network drivers (which we
get to in later chapters). Our ultimate aim is to write a modularized char driver, but
we won't talk about modularization issues in this chapter.
Throughout  the  chapter,  we  present  code  fragments  extracted  from  a  real  device
driver: scull (Simple Character Utility for Loading Localities). scull is a char driver
that acts on a memory area as though it were a device. In this chapter, because of
that peculiarity of scull, we use the word device interchangeably with "the memory
area used by scull."
