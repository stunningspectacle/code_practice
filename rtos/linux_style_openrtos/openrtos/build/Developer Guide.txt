Developers Guide
-----------------

The following rules apply when using the OpenRTOS API:
--------------------------------------------------------
1. API functions that do no end in "FromISR" must not be used in an interrupt service routine(ISR). 

2. API functions that can potentially cause a context switch must not be called while the
scheduler is suspended.

3. API functions that can potentially cause a context switch must not be called from within a critical section.
