/**
 * Create a single persistent task which periodically dynamically creates another
 * two tasks.  The original task is called the creator task, the two tasks it
 * creates are called suicidal tasks.
 *
 * One of the created suicidal tasks kill one other suicidal task before killing
 * itself - leaving just the original task remaining.
 *
 * The creator task must be spawned after all of the other demo application tasks
 * as it keeps a check on the number of tasks under the scheduler control.  The
 * number of tasks it expects to see running should never be greater than the
 * number of tasks that were in existence when the creator task was spawned, plus
 * one set of four suicidal tasks.  If this number is exceeded an error is flagged.
